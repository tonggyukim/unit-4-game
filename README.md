# Crystal Collector Game
Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery, I created this interactive game.

How to play: 
- There are four crystals displayed that each hold a different numerical value
- When you click the crystal, it will add that number to your total score
- When you reach the target value, you win the game
- If you exceed the target value, you will lose
